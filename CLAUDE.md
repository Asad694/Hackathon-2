# Hackathon II – Phase I Todo App

## Project Goal
Build an in-memory command-line todo application using Spec-Driven Development.

## Rules
- All code must be generated by Claude Code
- No manual code edits are allowed
- Specs are the single source of truth
- If behavior is incorrect, update the spec and regenerate

## Current Phase
Phase I – In-Memory Python Console Application

## Workflow
1. Read specs from /specs
2. Generate implementation based on specs
3. Follow clean Python project structure
4. Use Python 3.13+
